# API
We build HLP-Candidate to become the foundation of applications served by an [API](api.md). Changes to the API should be preceeded with in-depth discussion and introduced in accordance with the versioning scheme.

# Versioning
HLP-Candidate uses major.minor.patch version scheme. Versions within same major and minor but higher patch number should be drop-in backward compatible on API level.
A version with higher minor within the same major will add and might remove features, break API, database or network drop-in backward compatibility. 

# Pull Requests
Pulls should be focused, fix a bug, add a feature or refactore code, but not a mixture.  Bug fixes and features should be accompanied with test. Refactoring with wide scope, such as renaming a frequently used method should be discussed as a feature request and will be applied during dedicated re-factoring windows, that maintainer of the code base will announce regularly.

# Developer notes
We use IntelliJ's default formatting for Java code and Scalariform for scala. Please configure your choice of editor to produce similar layout.
Avoid re-formatting code, limit differences to aid code review.
